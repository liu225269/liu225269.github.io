title: "Identifying and Solving 3D NAND Specific Performance and Reliability Problems"
subtitle: ""
summary: "The invention of 3D NAND flash significantly increases the SSD density; however, 3D NAND flash inevitably induces the performance and lifetime issues compared to 2D NAND counterparts. This project identifies those 3D NAND induced problems and provides NAND architecture-level and SSD firmware-level solutions to address those problems. For example, the architecture-level solutions can be a new NAND chip command, while the firmware-level approaches can be a novel resource allocation scheme to manage 3D NAND flash."
