Chun-Yi Liu is a PhD student at Pennsylvania State Computer Engineering MDL lab. His research interests include Solid-state Disk(SSD) based storage system and high performance computing. More specific, he proposed and developed various techniques to address the performance and reliability problems caused by extremely high density 3D NAND-based SSDs. Besdies that, he also interesting in integrating high-performance computings and storage systems, where the overall system performance can be dramatically improved due to the reduced communication overheads between computation and storage.
